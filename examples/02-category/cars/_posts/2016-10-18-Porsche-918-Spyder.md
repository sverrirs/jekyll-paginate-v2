The Porsche 918 Spyder is a mid-engined plug-in hybrid sports car by Porsche.[3] The Spyder is powered by a naturally aspirated 4.6-litre V8 engine, developing 608 metric horsepower (447 kW), with two electric motors delivering an additional 279 metric horsepower (205 kW) for a combined output of 887 metric horsepower (652 kW). The 918 Spyder's 6.8 kWh lithium-ion battery pack delivers an all-electric range of 19 km (12 mi) under EPA's five-cycle tests.[1] The car has a top speed of around 340 km/h (210 mph).[4]

The 918 Spyder is a limited edition Hypercar, with 918 units manufactured and sold as a 2014 model year. Production began on September 18, 2013, with deliveries initially scheduled to begin in December 2013.[5][6] The starting price was US$847,000.[4] The 918 Spyder was sold out in December 2014. The country with the most orders was the United States with 294 units.[7][8] Canada ordered 35 units.[9] Production ended in June 2015.[10]

The 918 Spyder was first shown as a concept at the 80th Geneva Motor Show in March 2010.[5] The production version was unveiled at the September 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show.[11] Porsche also unveiled the RSR racing variant of the 918 at the 2011 North American International Auto Show, which combines hybrid technology first used in the 997 GT3 R Hybrid, with styling from the 918 Spyder.[12] The 918 Spyder was the second plug-in hybrid car from Porsche, after the 2014 Panamera S E-Hybrid.[13]
